Welcome to Internyant! The browser that doesn‚Äôt bow down to multi-trillion-dollar corporations or invasive ad systems. Internyant is here to flex on other browsers, and guess what? It‚Äôs born out of hacker-level shenanigans, with just a hint of Robin Hood spirit.

Features

No tracking, no bullshit: Privacy-first browsing with pre-installed, privacy-focused extensions like AdGuard, SponsorBlock, and Unhook.

Crunchyroll Calendar: Stay on top of your anime with the Crunchyroll release calendar.

Spoofed Manifest: Yes, I spoofed a trillion-dollar company with a blank manifest to get this working. Sit back and enjoy.

Dark Mode by Default: Because no one wants to be blinded by default light themes, right?

Fully Customizable: Theme it however you want! You‚Äôre in control.

Lightning Fast Setup: Up and running in no time, without corporate nonsense.

How It Works

Internyant is based on Chromium, with a fully pre-configured profile and all the extensions you could ever need. Streamlined, efficient, and made to make your life easier. You won‚Äôt have to do anything complicated‚Äîjust sit back and enjoy.


What About that "Placeholder" Extension?
Ah, yes. You‚Äôll see a fun little Placeholder extension in the list. This is purely decorative and exists to bypass some Chromium manifest-related nonsense. You can safely ignore it (but it does remind you how we outsmarted the system with a blank manifest file üòè).


Installation Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/bluedinosaur139/Internyant.git
cd Internyant
```

2. Run the Setup Script
Simply execute the setup script, and Internyant will handle everything for you, including installing Chromium and setting up all the pre-configured awesomeness.

```
sh launch-internyant.sh
```

ill add in desktop entry and other automation scripts later on check back often.


Workarounds

Manifest Warnings: These errors? What errors? Thanks to some crafty trickery, we spoofed Google‚Äôs manifest system with a blank manifest file. You might see a "Placeholder" extension‚Äîjust smile and move on.
DBus & GPU Warnings: Internyant might throw some warnings about DBus or GPU stuff when launching, but don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs nothing important. We added some flags to suppress most of them, but for the ones that sneak through, you can safely ignore them.


Theming & Customization

Internyant‚Äôs got dark mode locked down by default, but you can easily tweak themes and settings further using Chromium‚Äôs customization options. Make it as slick as you like!
